        <h1>Guide to Beating Nightmare King Grimm</h1>
        <p>In this guide, I will break down all of Grimm's moves / how to counter them as well as recommended charms</p>
        <p>Grimm is one of the hardest bosses in Hollow Knight, so fighting him is no easy task, hopefully this guide will help make it more manageable</p>

            <h4>DASH SLASH</h4>
                <p>He dashes toward you while slashing.</p>
                <img
                    src = "images/dash.jpg"
                    alt = "Dash Slash"
                    width = 50%/>
                <p>You can avoid this by jumping over him and downslashing as he passes</p>
            
            <h4>FIRE PILLAR</h4>
                <p>Spawns four fire pillars underneath you.</p>
                <img
                    src = "images/fire-pillar.jpg"
                    alt = "Fire Pillar"
                    width = 50%/>
                <p>You can avoid this by dashing horizontally as each pillar is about to hit you. In betweeen fire pillar spawns, he is very vulnerable, which allows you to get several hits.</p>
