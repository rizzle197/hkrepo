                  <p>He dashes toward you while slashing.</p>

                  <p>You can avoid this by jumping over him and downslashing as he passes</p>

            <section>
              <h4 class = "underline">FIRE PILLAR</h4>
                  <p>Spawns four fire pillars underneath you.</p>

                      alt = "Fire Pillar"
                      width = 25%/>
                  <p>You can avoid this by dashing horizontally as each pillar is about to hit you. In betweeen fire pillar spawns, he is very vulnerable, which allows you to get several hits.</p>
