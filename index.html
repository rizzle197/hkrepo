          <p class = "fw-bold">Grimm is one of the hardest bosses in Hollow Knight, so fighting him is no easy task, hopefully this guide will help make it more manageable</p>

                <p>You can avoid this by dashing horizontally as each pillar is about to hit you. In betweeen fire pillar spawns, he is very vulnerable, which allows you to get several hits.</p>
